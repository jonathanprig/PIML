# PIML
This project develops a hybrid, interpretable framework that integrates **physics-based resistance-capacitance** (RC) models with machine learning **(ML)** regression algorithms to predict indoor thermal dynamics in buildings. The workflow demonstrates how domain knowledge can be embedded within data-driven models to enhance interpretability and accuracy


🔹 **Key Features:**

Implemented **XGBoost** and **Neural Network (TensorFlow/Keras)** regression models trained on time-series data (100k+ records) generated from validated **ASHRAE 140** benchmark cases.

Conducted data preprocessing, scaling, and feature selection using **scikit-learn**, improving model generalisation and stability.

Achieved **R² = 0.93** and **MAE = 2.0 °C** in high-mass cases, highlighting strong predictive performance.

Visualised model behaviour through residual analysis and feature importance plots, supporting explainable decision-making.

Includes modular code for RC network generation, data simulation, and ML pipeline automation.


🔹 **Technical Stack:**

Python, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas


🔹 **Applications:**

Energy performance forecasting, Model interpretability, Time-series regression, Data analytics, Physics-informed ML
