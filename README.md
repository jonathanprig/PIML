# PIML
This project develops a hybrid, interpretable framework that integrates physics-based resistance-capacitance (RC) models with machine learning regression algorithms to predict indoor thermal dynamics in buildings. The workflow demonstrates how domain knowledge can be embedded within data-driven models to enhance interpretability and accuracy
